# Online_Code_Editor_Project-Elevate_Labs:

This is a small project I made using **React + Vite** and also to test how Monaco editor works inside React.  
It’s basically a mini **online code editor** where you can write HTML, CSS, JS and see live preview at the same time.

### ✨ Features:
- Multi-tab editor (HTML / CSS / JS)
- Live preview inside iframe
- Save code in localStorage (so refresh won't loose stuff)
- Share code via url compression
- Switch layouts (side-by-side, only preview, only editor)
- Some starter templates to try out quickly

### ⚙️ How to run:
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayushverma0508/Online_Code_Editor_Project-Elevate_Labs.git
   cd Online_Code_Editor_Project-Elevate_Labs


Install deps:
- bash
- Copy code
- npm install

Run in dev mode:
- bash
- Copy code
- npm run dev

Output URL:
open http://localhost:5173/

⚠️ Notes:
- Sometimes monaco editor takes a bit to load (don’t worry)
- I didn’t polish css too much, its just functional
- Css not very fancy, just works
- Code is not “perfect”, i wrote as i was learning 😅
